Citizens will be donors by connecting their own computing resources, such us smart phones, desktop computers or other devices to science infrastructure. But, citizens will also be actors when they actively participate in the scientific process, in different phases: from short and easy activities to the inception of new research lines, leading people driven developments or in the development of software components, similar to open-source communities. We propose to open e-science to the people, even considering the knowledge and the time of the citizen scientists as part of the resources that constitute the e-infrastructures, and call this enhanced citizen-based infrastructure “c-infrastructure”.') }}
