  "alive_form_info" : "In the first screen the total number of cells must be indicated, classifying them as live or dead.<br><br>The image displayed by default (letâ€™s call it normal channel) is the result of overlapping three images: one in bright field (grey tones), one in blue fluorescence (to see the nuclei) and other one in Green (to see the mitochondria). In order to observe nuclei or mitochondria separately, it is possible to choose the blue or green channel. This facilitates the observation of each of these organelles individually.<br><br>The most common shape of these cells resembles an elongated spindle, although they can also adopt other shapes like stars, spheres, etc. These cells grow adhered to the culture surface. Thus, when they are alive, they get any of the abovementioned shapes with rounded, oval or bean-shaped relatively uniform nuclei. Mitochondria usually look like a network of worms.<br><br>Cells that die by apoptosis get rounded first, and then they shrink as the membrane blebs (this is, appears to form bubbles).. The nucleus shrinks and might also get fragmented. In that case, blue color gets more intense since the fluorescent dye gets concentrated in a smaller volume. Mitochondria get also fragmented appearing as dots or little spheres instead of worms. However, cells get also rounded when they divide by mitosis, therefore if we observe a rounded cell with a smooth surface (perimeter), we cannot tell if it is getting rounded to die or to divide (there are some details that could help us distinguish each process, but we will not get into them here). The best way to know if a rounded cell is dividing is to check the following frames, over time. If it is dividing, one or two frames later (30-60 minutes) there will be two cells instead of one. If it is dying, it stays rounded for several frames until shrinking, blebbing, or even getting fragmented.<br><br>If the cell dies by necrosis, it usually keeps its shape and size, although it can shrink lightly. Nucleus keeps its shape and mitochondria can get fragmented. However, the major characteristic of necrosis is cell content release (cytosol) which is observed as one or several bubbles growing up around the cell.<br><br>Usually, a live and healthy cell tends to adopt a flattened shape with a rounded and homogeneous nucleus, a wide cytoplasm (what surrounds the nucleus) and worm-shaped mitochondria distributed along the whole cytosol.",
  "cellular_shape_form_info_1" : "In this step we will analyze the shape of the cells. They must be classified as elongated, rounded or star-shaped. This can give as an idea of the physiological status of the cell, not just the shape itself, but also the changes from one shape to another. Static cells that do not change their shape indicate that something is not working properly, probably due to an effect on the cytoskeleton of the compound they are treated with.<br><br>We will consider elongated cells those with a length that is at least double than its width. This can include a broad spectrum of cells and, in general, it will be the most common shape. According to these criteria, we can find cells like the following ones:<br><br><ul><li>Elongated cells are those with a length that is at least double than its width. Some examples are the following:<br><br></li></ul>",
  "cellular_shape_form_info_2" : "<br><br><ul><li>Rounded cells are those that look almost like a perfect circle (in fact, an sphere). These are cells that are either starting to die by apoptosis or dividing. Since they change from a flattened shape to a spherical one, they appear to be smaller than flattened cells, although the maintain basically the same volume. Some examples are the following:<br><br></li></ul>",
  "cellular_shape_form_info_3" : "<br><br><ul><li>Star-shaped cells are those that have at least three points, this is, those that look like a three-pointed star, four pointed star, etc. Let's see some examples.<br><br></li></ul>",

  "release_form_info_1" : "Cell content release is observed as transparent bubbles around the cells. If we observe the video below (recommended to watch it in full-screen mode) we can see them clearly growing starting at several positions in the cell perimeter. In that video mainly the cells on the left are those releasing cell content. It is released when the plasma membrane looses its integrity, that is, it gets broken or pores appear. The cytosolic liquid escapes through those pores. If those pores are big enough, even some organelles might get out of the cell.<br><br>Cell content release without a significant change in the overall morphology of the cell is indicative of death by necrosis. If the cell has previously shrunk and suffered membrane blebbing, releasing the intracellular content later, this indicates that the cell has died by apoptosis and then loosed membrane integrity. During apoptosis, no cell content is released, and, although cells get fragmented in apoptotic bodies, those will be always surrounded by membrane. Nevertheless, at then end of the process that membrane can break, and therefore cell content release can be observed.",
  "nucleus_shape_form_info_1" : "The shape of the nuclei must be classified in this step. Rounded, elongated or bean-shaped nuclei usually indicate live and healthy cells. Nevertheless the same shapes can be observed in cells dying by necrosis, although in this case there would be cell content release and the cell would not move at all. Fragmented nuclei or with clearly more intense blue color than usual, and shrunk too, indicate death by apoptosis.<br><br>If the nucleus appears like a band, the cell is dividing. That band is the metaphase plate, which contains grouped chromosomes aligned to be split into the two daughter cells.. If two of these bands are very close to each other and parallel (image on the right),",
  "nucleus_shape_form_info_2" : "that means that each set of chromosomes has already started to move towards what will be each new cell (they are in a phase of mitosis known as anaphase). If flattened cells (with any of the shapes, apart from the round one, described before, this is, cells that are not dividing) have more than one nucleus, this indicates that problems appeared during mitosis, the nucleus divided, but the cell was unable to do it. Multinucleated cells can appear after several rounds of aberrant mitosis. This usually indicates problems with the cytoskeleton (the microtubules that pull apart the chromosomes during mitosis).",
  "anaphase" : "Example of anaphase",
  "mitocohondria_form_shape_info" : "We now have to classify cells according to the shape of their mitochondria.<br><br>Healthy cells usually have worm-shaped mitochondria evenly distributed throughout the cytosol. Dotted mitochondria are indicative that something is wrong with the cell. Mitochondrial fragmentation (this is, change from worms to dots) usually occurs during cell death, mainly by apoptosis. It is usually hard to find cells with a healthy shape (flattened) and rounded mitochondria, since mitochondrial fragmentation and cellular shrinking usually happen together during apoptosis.",
  "mitocohondria_form_distribution_info" : "Cells with scattered mitochondria or evenly distributed within the cytosol must be differentiated from the ones where mitochondria are clustered in one or  more regions inside the cell. Mitochondrial clusters, when present, are usually located close to the nucleus. Some times they can even distort the nuclear shape. Mitochondrial clustering is usually associated to mitochondrial fragmentation and cell rounding or shrinking.",
  "movility_nuclei_form_info" : "In this step the goal is to estimate the mobility of the cells. Let's consider two types of mobility: displacement along the culture surface and changes in shape. The first one will be analyzed in this step and the second one, in the following step.<br><br>Displacement implies that the whole cell changes its position. This can be more easily observed if we consider the nucleus as the center of the cell and look as significant changes in nuclei position. By significant we mean that the nuclei has not just moved inside the cell without the cell changing its position, but that the whole cell is clearly moving around. We will not consider  significant the movement of a cell when the distance travelled is less than twice its own size. We will neither consider as displacement subtle changes in position when the cells gets rounded to divide and when the two daughter cells slightly separate from each other immediately after division.",
  "movility_surface_form_info" : "The mobility to be analyzed at this step is the one related to the shape change.<br><br>When cells move they usually extend first part of the cytoplasm (with the membrane around it) in the direction they want to move. If those cytoplasm projections are flat and wide they are known as lamellipodia, if they are thin like spikes, they are known as filopodia. Filopodia can appear as projections from lamellipodia. Apart from moving, cells also use these structures to sense the environment (some protozoa like amoebas look for food in this way). Cell can also touch each other with these structures. Although these structures can be accompanied by cell displacement, they can also be extended, contracted or moved around the cell without significant changes in overall cell position (i.e., the nuclei is not moving around). This is the type of movement we want to address in this step.",
